# kNN
Project to study the method of k nearest neighbours applied to a music classification data set. k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.

The tasks followed are as below:
• Loading the data set
• Standardising all the columns
• Dividing the data set up into a training and test set
• Writing a function which runs k nearest neighbours (kNN) on the data set
• Checking which value of k produces the smallest misclassification rate on the training set
• Predicting on the test set to see how it does.
